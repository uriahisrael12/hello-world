My name is Jeston Hale. I'm a sophomore computer engineering major at Jackson State University. I plan to have a career as an audio technician or engineer. I love music and sound and play the trumpet and piano. My parents are also musicians; my mother is an opera professor at JSU and my father plays the double bass in the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra (MSO).
